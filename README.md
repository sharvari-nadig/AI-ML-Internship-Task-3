# Task 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Dataset Used
Iris Dataset

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

## Objective
To explore and analyze the dataset using visualizations in order to understand data patterns, feature relationships, and important features.

## EDA Steps Performed
- Plotted histograms to analyze distribution of numerical features
- Analyzed categorical features using count plot
- Identified outliers using box plots
- Visualized feature relationships using correlation heatmap
- Identified important features for prediction

## Key Insights
- Petal length and petal width show strong correlation
- Petal features are most important for prediction
- Dataset has no class imbalance
- Very few outliers present in the data

## Files in this Repository
- Task3_EDA.ipynb
- README.md

## Outcome
Gained understanding of data patterns, feature behavior, and importance of visualization in exploratory data analysis.
